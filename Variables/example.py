# Rules for variable names
    # Names can not start with a number.
    # There can be no spaces in the name, use _ instead.
#     It's considered best practice (PEP8) that names are lowercase.

# Python uses Dynamic Typing
# This means you can reassign variables to different data types.

a= 10
print (a)
print(type(a))
a= "Python"  #  Reassignment of variables is Ok in python.
print(a)
print((type(a)))
